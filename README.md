# Weather-app 

### Note: Once you open the website and see loading process without result, it is based on limitation of API. Thanks for your understanding !!!

+ Have developed the Weather App to understand how to work with API.
+ Have worked with design from scratch to be much better UI and UX (if any mistakes, please let me know).
+ Have tried to work with the features of ES6.
+ Have used only Vanilla Js.
+ Have taken different Weather's states here to feel the look [Figma link](https://www.figma.com/file/XQOAnRHbQLnYnuFVFOzFWe/weather-app).
